## üîç Overview

MediSmart AI is a groundbreaking solution that transforms how pharmacies handle prescriptions. Our system not only reads and interprets handwritten prescriptions but goes a step further by suggesting alternative medications and providing disease-specific drug recommendations. Think of it as having a knowledgeable assistant who never gets tired, never overlooks details, and always stays updated with the latest medical knowledge!

## üéØ Problem Statement

### Prescription Interpretation Challenges
- 7% of medication errors stem from misread prescriptions
- Average time spent decoding complex prescriptions: 15 minutes
- Multi-language prescriptions create additional barriers

### Drug Selection Issues
- Limited access to alternative medication information
- Incomplete knowledge of drug interactions
- Time constraints in researching options

### Patient Impact
- Extended wait times (average 30+ minutes)
- Higher medication costs due to limited alternative awareness
- Potential health risks from prescription misinterpretation
